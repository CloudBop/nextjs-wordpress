## frontend

Nextjs, tailwind, cypress, apollo, authenticated previews

## wp-backend

Docker configuration for WordPress. (?) **hopefully** this configures the plugins.

yoast
wpgraphql
wpgraphql-jwt-authentication
wpgraphql-offset-pagination
add-wpgraphql-seo

and more...

Watchout, plugin composition can fail

- incompat php
- incompat wp->plugin

previous problem where old yoast incompat with php8

Can install all plugins manually.
